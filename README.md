# CPNO: Physics-Informed Chebyshev Polynomial Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations

## Overview
CPNO is an innovative neural operator framework that integrates physics-informed learning with Chebyshev spectral methods to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently. This project implements a forward and backward pass algorithm for a Chebyshev Polynomial Neural Operator (CPNO), leveraging multi-scale spectral features and physics constraints to enhance predictive accuracy for spatiotemporal problems.
